# Summary
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the recommended daily consumption of fruits for a healthier life is 400 grams per person. However, in Indonesia, the average consumption stands at only 81.14 grams per capita per day (BPS, 2021). This figure represents just 54.09% of the minimum nutritional adequacy threshold set by the WHO. The public struggles with fruit selection due to limited awareness of their nutritional benefits, leading to repetitive choices and potential health deficiencies. This lack of diversity in fruit consumption is highlighted by WHO and BPS (2021) data. Embracing more natural fruit options could effectively address health concerns by reducing chemical intake and promoting overall well-being.

Creating an Android application that is able to classify various fruit images might be the solution to the challenge of “How to improve healthy fruit consumption in Indonesia?”. There is a feature that justifies the relevance of this application in addressing the problem. The ability to classify popular Indonesian fruits by capturing an image of the fruit could offer a more interactive experience compared to browsing the internet. After the fruits are identified, the application would display detailed information about the fruit's nutritional content, serving methods, dietary benefits, and potential health benefits. The aim of our application is to help users choose fruit easily based on the nutritional information provided and reduce consumption of chemicals.
